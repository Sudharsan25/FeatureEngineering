Life cycle of a data science project.

1. Data collection
2. Feature engineering
   -> Handling missing values(Cont data, Categorical data)
  
    => Types of Missing data:
        1. Missing completely at Random(MCAR)
            There is absolutely no relationship with data missing and any other values, observed or missing, within in the dataset.
            Eg: If two colums in a dataframe has more null values , then the first column's missing data has absolutely no relationship
            with the second column's missing data.
         2. Missing not at random(MNAR) or Systematic missing values
             There is some relationshoip present with the data missing and other values, observed or missing within the datset
         3. Missing at random(MAR)
             Data is missing because of random factors, like the data from surveys, etc,.
    => Techniques of Handling the Missing values
        1. Mean/Median/Mode Replacement - Replacing the missing values by most frequent occurance of a variable. Used when MAR
            Advantages:
                *Easy to implement (Robust to outliers)
                *Faster way to obtain complete dataset
            Disadvantages:
                *Change or distortion of original variance
                *Impacts Correlation
        2. Random sample Imputation
        3. Capturing Nan values with a new feature
        4. End of distribution Imputation
        5. Arbitrary Imputation
        6. Frequent Categories Imputation
